# Terence's Next Big Thing

Terence Lee, an esteemed Senior Member of the Technical Staff, Ruby Task Force Leader and Jedi Level Conference Speaker, is so impressed with the skill level of gSchool that he's ready to leave it all behind to invest in one of you. However, to help determine where is millions of dollars will go, he's tasked you all with a challenge.

He wants a small sinatra application with a catchy name and an email sign up. This application must be on Heroku (obviously) within the hour to qualify. The email sign up should be front and center! To prove your technical chops, the email signup should save every email that comes through in a database.

Good luck! This could be it!
